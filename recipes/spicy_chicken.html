            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p> A nice spicy blend of peppers and a hint of Indian. My family loves this. Can be made mild to super-spicy. Add more serrano peppers or substitute Madras, vindaloo, or phaal curry for the milder yellow curry for more heat that'll send you straight to Vallhala.</p>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            
            <ol>

                <li>Cook and stir chicken pieces in 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat until chicken is white outside and slightly pink inside, 5 to 8 minutes. Add tomatoes, mango, sweet onion, serrano peppers, white pepper, dry mustard, curry powder, and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until chicken and onion are very tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>While curry is simmering, bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and fluffy and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Bring a skillet of lightly-salted water to a boil, reduce heat, and place asparagus into the boiling water. Cook until asparagus are tender and still bright green, about 12 minutes; drain water and drizzle asparagus with 3 tablespoons melted butter.</li>
                <li>To serve, spoon rice onto serving plates and top each serving with several asparagus spears; top with chicken curry.</li>
